# Makes PhantomBuster easier to use by automatically retrieving your session cookies

PhantomBuster is the growth-hackers favorite weapon. Elected best Growth-hacking tool of 2018 by the Bad-Ass Marketers and Founders, they keep innovating thanks to their digital marketing platform.

On our path to make Growth-hacking available to non-technical people we've decided to simplify the process of filling out your session cookies.

This extension will automatically retrieve the session cookies of the websites you're connected to. Once you're in PhantomBuster, just click on "Add Cookie" to fill the session cookies input field.
